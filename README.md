# Eco Vending Machine: Detailed Concept Description

## 1. Concept Overview
The *Eco Vending Machine (EVM)* is an innovative solution designed to promote recycling by rewarding users for depositing recyclable waste, such as plastic bottles, cans, and other materials. This system consists of a *smart recycling machine* paired with a *dedicated mobile application*. By combining environmental sustainability with technology and incentives, the EVM aims to cultivate eco-friendly habits among individuals, particularly in urban areas, educational institutions, corporate offices, and public spaces.

## 2. How It Works
### a) *Smart Eco Vending Machine (EVM)*
- The machine is equipped with hardware components such as a *QR code scanner, **weight sensors, **internal waste collectors, and **network connectivity* (Wi-Fi/IoT modules).
- When a user approaches the machine to deposit waste, the machine generates a *dynamic QR code*.
- Users scan this QR code using their *Eco Vending Machine mobile app*, linking the deposit session with their account.
- After scanning, users deposit recyclable items into the machine.
- The machine verifies the deposit (through weight or volume sensors) and sends confirmation to the backend server.

### b) *Mobile Application*
- Users first *register* or *log in* to the mobile app.
- After scanning the EVMâ€™s QR code, users *deposit their recyclables*.
- The app *records each deposit, assigns **eco-points* based on the quantity/weight/type of recyclable material, and *updates the userâ€™s reward balance*.
- Users can *track their recycling history, **view available rewards* (such as coupons, discounts, or cashbacks), and *redeem points* for tangible benefits.

## 3. Core Features
### Smart Vending Machine:
- *Dynamic QR Code Generation* for secure deposit sessions.
- *Real-time Weight/Volume Measurement* to verify deposited waste.
- *Secure Server Communication* to update transactions instantly.
- *Waste Categorization* (optional advanced feature) to reward based on material type.

### Mobile App:
- *User Authentication* (Signup, Login, Password Recovery)
- *QR Code Scanner* for connecting to the machine.
- *Transaction History* (list of deposits, rewards earned)
- *Rewards Catalog* where users can redeem eco-points.
- *Push Notifications* for updates, campaigns, and promotions.
- *Leaderboard (optional)* to encourage competition among recyclers.

### Backend Server:
- *API Layer* for communication between mobile app, machine, and database.
- *Database Management* for users, transactions, and rewards.
- *Admin Panel* for monitoring machine health, user activity, and managing reward programs.

## 5. Technology Stack
- *Hardware*: Raspberry Pi (controller), QR code module, Weight sensor (HX711 + Load Cell), LCD Display.
- *Software for App*: Flutter or React Native (cross-platform mobile app development).
- *Backend Server*: Node.js with Express or Firebase Functions.
- *Database*: MongoDB Atlas / Google Firestore for scalability and real-time updates.
- *Cloud Hosting*: AWS / Google Cloud for hosting backend services and data storage.

## 6. User Journey Example
1. User downloads and installs the *Eco Vending Machine* app.
2. Registers and logs in to the app.
3. Finds an *Eco Vending Machine* nearby.
4. Scans the *dynamic QR code* displayed on the machine.
5. Deposits recyclable items into the machine.
6. Instantly receives *eco-points* added to their app wallet.
7. Accumulates points and *redeems rewards* like shopping vouchers, free coffee, event tickets, or charitable donations.
8. (Optional) Sees their ranking on a *leaderboard* for top recyclers.

## 7. Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)
- *AI-based Material Recognition*: To verify and categorize waste automatically.
- *Blockchain Integration*: For transparent tracking of recycling activity and carbon credits.
- *Partnerships with Brands*: Local businesses can offer discounts/coupons through the app.
- *Gamification*: Badges, levels, and monthly competitions to increase user engagement.
- *Carbon Footprint Calculator*: Showing users the positive impact they have made.
